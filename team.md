<p align="justify">Ziling Zhu is a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. As a formal and experimental semanticist, she explores the meaning of natural language by integrating theoretical analysis and experimental methods. Her research spans both the clausal and nominal domains. On the theoretical side, she focuses on topics including attitude predicates, presuppositions, question-embeddings, modal subordination, and anaphoricity. She has also conducted experimental studies on the nominal domain, investigating the semantics of demonstratives, classifiers, and nouns. Before that, she received a B.A. at Fudan University, majoring in English and minoring in Chinese. Beyond linguistics, selected life interests include cats, chocolate, culture, and cooking. Her MBTI is ENFJ.</p>
